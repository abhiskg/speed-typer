          Q: What is the difference between Local storage and Session storage?
        </h2>
        <p class="blog-answer">
          Ans: The main difference between local storage and session storage is
          that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage
          is cleared when the page session ends. To delete localStorage data we
          have to do it manually or via javaScript. On the other hand session
          storage is session-based and works per window or tab. This means that
          data is stored only for the duration of a session, i.e., until the
          browser (or tab) is closed. The storage capacity of local storage is
          5MB/10MB. The storage capacity of session storage is 5MB.

          Q: What is the difference between global scope and block scope?
        </h2>
        <p class="blog-answer">
          Ans: Scope in JavaScript refers to the current context of code. A
          variable defined within a block/{ } will not be accessible from
          outside the block. A block can reside inside a function, and a block
          scoped variable will not be available outside the block even if the
          block is inside a function. let and const keywords provide Block Scope
          in JavaScript. A variable defined outside of block or function is
          called global scoped variable, and that variable is accessible from
          anywhere in the javaScript file.

        <h2 class="blog-question">Q: How Event loop works in JavaScript?</h2>
        <p class="blog-answer">
          Ans: Event loop has one simple job, that is to monitor call stack and
          task queue. The Async function first comes to the stack then moves to
          the webapi for its operation to execute and comes to the task queue
          for stacks to be empty. After the synchronous operation, if Even loop
          sees the stack is empty, it will push the first operation in the task
          queue to stack, which effectively runs it.

        <h2 class="blog-question">Q: How many ways we can get undefined?</h2>
        <p class="blog-answer">
          Ans: There are several ways we can get undefined. Those are:
        </p>
        <p class="blog-answer">
          1. Variable that is declared but not initialized.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-answer">
          2. Function parameter that is not passed will be undefined
        </p>
        <p class="blog-answer">
          3. If you return from a function but with no value/variable, that will
          be undefined
        </p>
        <p class="blog-answer">
          4. Property that doesn't exist on an object, will give undefined.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-answer">
          5. Accessing an array element outside of that array index range gives
          undefined.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-answer">
          6. Deleting an element inside of an array and then accessing that will
          give undefined.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-answer">7. Function with no return</p>
